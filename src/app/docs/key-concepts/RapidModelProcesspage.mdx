# Koi's Accelerated Modeling Process

<PageInformationalData lastModified={lastModified} />

---

## Overview

Koi offers unrivaled speed and accuracy in model delivery. As the first and only platform to provide on-demand, customized avoided emissions models, it is designed to equip innovators and investors with analytics that accommodate different use cases, timelines, and technologies. Koi models are built on a validated data lake that integrates extensively curated, foundational data from reliable sources such as the IEA, SBTi, and Ecoinvent. Using trustworthy emissions baseline and market data as a foundation, Koi’s innovative computational engine instantly constructs a climate solution technology model that includes anticipated life cycle intervention points and potential market uptake.

## Integrating Automation into Commissioned Forecasting Services

Koi’s [model pricing](https://koi.eco/pricing) is designed to accommodate a wide spectrum of analytical needs and climate strategies. All Koi license holders have access to the data lake and previously constructed models via the search engine. Users can customize models in Koi Studio to incorporate their specific data and modify parameters as desired. In cases where an appropriate model does not yet exist, or the user has modification requests they prefer not to implement themselves, commissioning a new model may be of interest.

Koi lowers all barriers to obtaining customized, forward-looking emissions models. Historically, the status quo was for analysts to maintain internal spreadsheets tracking reliable data sources for emissions intensities and market sizes. These spreadsheets served as data libraries for constructing analyses on a case-by-case basis—often lacking technology specificity and requiring weeks of manual research by specialists. This legacy approach is not only time- and cost-intensive but also prone to errors, difficult to maintain, and cumbersome to share and collaborate on. Nevertheless, expert manual review offers substantial benefits and is why we offer a hybrid approach with our expert forecasting services.

Forecasting services are offered in multiple tiers for maximum flexibility across use cases. Every new model begins with the autogenerated draft that is then reviewed or modified by a trained scientist. Despite rapid advancements in AI and our meticulous data lake curation, we do not currently offer Koi’s autogenerated models for purchase without essential quality assurance. Termed **rapid models** in our pricing options, these models follow the above flow process with the addition of having key parameters checked and refined for accuracy before delivery on the platform. Every model accessible through the Koi search engine for license holders meets this essential quality assurance standard, with some having received additional manual refinements that add significant nuance.

## Use Case Considerations

Different use cases require different considerations of technology nuance and detail. Some Koi users model the potential impact of early-stage ventures, where significant uncertainty surrounds both the future product and target market. These users often find that rapid models are well-suited to their needs given the inherent uncertainty, the wide range of technologies under consideration, and budget constraints. Conversely, other users require a deep understanding of potential investment impacts and prefer our higher-tier models, which integrate our scientists’ technical expertise through stakeholder engagement and discovery, while still leveraging the efficiencies of automated modeling. 

Starting with the autogenerated model, our scientists maximize time efficiency by focusing on the details that matter—whether it's regional specificity, incorporating insights from white papers or technical reports, or modeling unique lifecycle phases for the solution. This approach allows for the generation of best-in-class models in a fraction of the traditional time. Further, anchoring models to the foundational data lake not only saves precious time but also ensures consistency and data intercompatibility across analyses both now and in the future as the underlying data are updated.

## Next steps

- For more information about each model tier, check out the [forecasting services pricing table](https://koi.eco/pricing) and the informational popups for each feature. 
- Allowing users to access autogenerated models and perform their own quality assurance via a guided process is on our [roadmap](https://product.koi.eco/roadmap?q=quality). If this is an important feature to you, please consider providing feedback within the roadmap.
